    <h2>The Situation</h2>
    <p>All over the world, there are billions of humans doing the exact same thing; breathing. Without oxygen, we cannot hope to sustain life on this planet, and a huge contributor to oxygen content on the planet? You guessed it, trees. Trees, from ripe young saplings to gnarled ancient giants, pump out oxygen and take in carbon dioxide while also providing us with wood which is used in countless products. Overall, without trees there might be no humans. Worth saving them, right?</p>

    <h2>What We've Done Already</h2>
    <p>Already we've taken the fight worldwide. We've branched out and planted over a billion trees in deforested areas; we've leafed through every lawbook in existance to take companies to court over environmentally bad policies; and with the hard work of thousands of volunteers, we've managed to stop logging in the Amazon forest.</p>

    <h2>Your Part</h2>
    <p>Without new volunteers, our strength is sapped; our efforts, truncated. Come out on a limb for us and help us save our green planet, save humanity, one tree at a time.</p>
